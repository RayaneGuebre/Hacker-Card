Today I've started designing the actual business car, but I'm not sure how to make it unique. I'm not designer/artist :), Tomorrow I'm gonna browse other hackclubbers' hacker cards and see how they have designed it, i've already seen one with the moon and a lot of start, i could try to do something similar but with mountains since i like hiking, but idk, i'm tired and i just wanna sleep, good night.

Soooo, I've finished the design for the back of the card, and I've had a great idea for the front. I wanted to make it kinda personal. So I decided to put my favourite painting, The Starry Night. I don't know for what reason i like it so much, but it is still my favourite. The only problem, though, is that I've redrawn it with my mouse... It's going to be hard, but it's still possible. Tomorrow I'm gonna see what I can do
