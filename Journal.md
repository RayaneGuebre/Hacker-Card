Today I've started designing the actual business car, but I'm not sure how to make it unique. I'm not designer/artist :), Tomorrow I'm gonna browse other hackclubbers' hacker cards and see how they have designed it, i've already seen one with the moon and a lot of start, i could try to do something similar but with mountains since i like hiking, but idk, i'm tired and i just wanna sleep, good night.
