##18/07 
today i've started designing the actual business card but i'm not really sure how to make it unique, I'm not a designer / artist :')
tomorrow i'm gonna browse other hackclubbers hacker cards and see how they have designed it, i've already seen one with the moon and a lot of start, i could try to do something similar but with mountains since i like hiking, but idk,i'm tired and i just wanna go sleep, good night.
